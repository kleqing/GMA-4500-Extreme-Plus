# GMA-4500-Extreme-Plus

## ⚠️ This is a tool that it will install the Intel(R) HD Graphics Family driver to your computer.

## 💾 How to install?
	* Run 3 file on the main folder (File 1, 2 and 3) step-by-step

## ❔ How about the Extra folder?
	* It is a Extra tweak which will help you fix some issues after install.

### ⭕ Explain Tweaks
	* Over Clocking: It is a hack to raise the Voltage of the GPU (A mild raise through official mean)
	 which actually lets it perform quite fast, however I know some do not like to come to over-clocking
	 as myth say they shorten the life cycle of hardware and since this is probably your only PC and that 
	 probably you dont have a cooling pad then is up to you to disable it (Enabled by default).


	* Increase Quality: It will increase the quality of the image (Disabled by default).

	* (Hybird) Kernel Beta: This is a batch files that switch between the different kernels
	 where there is a beta one that was released by Intel but never ever was integrated in
	 any of its drivers (Code named Kernel 600) and the other was the trusty one used by me
	 in previous release of this driver (Code named  Kernel 500), you can notice more vivid 
	 graphics, shadows and smoke but at the expence of lower frame rates you can live with.
	- ON injects the beta kernel and makes use of it
	- OFF goes back to normal trusty kernel (Selected by default)
	- Hybrid injects the beta kernel for 64bit apps leaving 32bit apps work with the normal
	 trusty kernel which is the most ideal

	 * OpenGL: It is a version enabler, this batch when applied may fool a game or program into believing 
	 this GPU is an OpenGL 4.6 capable GPU and let it run this however doesn't change the fact that the
	 GPU isn't OpenGL 4.6 capable GPU but may allow you enterance to app for debuging/graphics level 
	 downgrading just, this setting is for test purpose only and should be set back to Normal after use.
	 On a side notice this may not fool games or programs that look up GPUs by Device ID and check for 
	 its true capabilities.
