# GMA-4500-Extreme-Plus

## ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a tool that it will install the Intel(R) HD Graphics Family driver to your computer.

## üíæ How to install?
	* Run 3 file on the main folder (File 1, 2 and 3) step-by-step

## ‚ùî How about the Extra folder?
	* It is a Extra tweak which will help you fix some issues after install.

### ‚≠ï Explain Tweaks
	* Over Clocking: It is a hack to raise the Voltage of the GPU (A mild raise through official mean)
	 which actually lets it perform quite fast, however I know some do not like to come to over-clocking
	 as myth say they shorten the life cycle of hardware and since this is probably your only PC and that 
	 probably you dont have a cooling pad then is up to you to disable it (Enabled by default).


	* Increase Quality: It will increase the quality of the image (Disabled by default).

	* (Hybird) Kernel Beta: This is a batch files that switch between the different kernels where there is a beta
	 one that was released by Intel but never ever was integrated in any of its drivers (Code named Kernel 600) and the
	 other was the trusty one used by me in previous release of this driver (Code named  Kernel 500), you can notice more
	 vivid graphics, shadows and smoke but at the expence of lower frame rates you can live with .
	- ON injects the beta kernel and makes use of it
	- OFF goes back to normal trusty kernel (Selected by default)
	- Hybrid injects the beta kernel for 64bit apps leaving 32bit apps work with the normal
	 trusty kernel which is the most ideal

	 * OpenGL: It is a version enabler, this batch when applied may fool a game or program into believing this GPU
	  is an OpenGL 4.6 capable GPU and let it run this however doesn't change the fact that the GPU isn't OpenGL 4.6
	  capable GPU but may allow you enterance to app for debuging/graphics level downgrading just, this setting is 
	  for test purpose only and should be set back to Normal after use. On a side notice this may not fool games or 
	  programs that look up GPUs by Device ID and check for its true capabilities.
